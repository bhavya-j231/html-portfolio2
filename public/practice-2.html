<p>Book number 2<br />  
<strong>The Pride and Prejudice</strong> <br />
Author: Jane Austen<br />

This story deals with the revolutionary ideas a woman has in a society that is conservative for women and their  rights. The story not just focuses on the romantic novel theme but rather the force that helps people to change from within and enables them to question the age old practices that are oppresive and humiliative to a certain community in this case the women community.</p>

<p>Book number 1<br />  
<strong>To kill a Mockingbird</strong> <br />
Author: Harper Lee<br />

This book according to me is an all time classic. Everything about it is just so fine. This book primarily focuses on teaching the kids the right things they need to know. To teach them love, kindness, forgiveness should be the prime motive of every parent rather than using violence to keep them under control. Children are like birds, they are meant to fly not caged however if they are caged they lose all hopes and turn against the human values that primarily define us for what we are. However the best thing about this book is that it focuses on the age old marginilization that is still practiced in most parts of our societies. </p>
